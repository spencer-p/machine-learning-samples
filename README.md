# Machine Learning Coding Samples

This repository holds sample code I write as I learn about machine learning
algorithms, mostly in CMPS 142 at UCSC.

Should anybody ever use this code? Probably not. This is mostly for my learning
purposes, or for anybody to convince themselves I understand this material.
